Discrete-event simulation, grocery store

# What is currently done



Event and its subclasss are added. When excuting a event is is replaced with the following event. The time logic is not added

EventQueue is mostly done I think. When EventQueue executes an event it now notifies View and StoreView is able to print stuff.




### Todo

Figure out how the queue for the checkout is supposed to work with EventQueue. Also how the queue into the the store will work with EventQueue. 


- [x] Event 
- [x] EventQueue
- [ ] Specific Event (Arrival Event etc)
- [ ] StoreState
- [x] State
- [x] View
- [ ] StoreView  
- [ ] Everything else
