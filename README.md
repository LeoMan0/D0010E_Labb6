Discrete-event simulation, grocery store

# What is currently done



Event and its subclasss are added. When excuting a event is is replaced with the following event. The time logic is not added

EventQueue is mostly done I think. When EventQueue executes an event it now notifies View and StoreView is able to print stuff.

Add build sim
Cleanup
